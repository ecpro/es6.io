  /* 
    
    Difference between var, let and const : 

    var keyword : 
    1. var has function scope. A variable name declared using var keywords can be 
    re-declared to another value.
    eg var key = "banana";
      var key = "apple";

    2. it can be re-assigned. 
    var point = 50;
    point = 'Piyush';

    3. if variable declared with var is not any function scope then its default scope is global ie. on window object.

    let keyword : 
    1. block scoped, cannot be re-daclared with same name in same scope but re-assignable.
    2. if not in block scope, it does not attach to window object like 'var'

    const keyword : 
    1. block scoped, cannot be re-declared or re-assigned to a new value.
    2. const does not make object immutable. In below example 'person' object has been declared using const but we can add/modify properties on it but cannot assign it to new object.
    3. it also does not attach itself to window object if not within a function.

    4. To make objects immutable Ojbect.freeze(obj) is used as shown below.

    Note :  let, const eleminated variable leak from for loop. Example below.

  */

  const key = 'abc123';
  let points = 50;
  let winner = false;
  var loser = "qwerty";
  const person = {
    name: 'Wes',
    age: 28
  }

  const wes = Object.freeze(person);

  /* variable leak example */

  for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    // some code here
  }
  // since i is not inside a function so global scoped and even if the for loop has finished it is still there

  console.info('i variable leaked ', i);

// it won't happen if we use let instead

for(let x = 0; x < 10; x++) {
  // some code here
}
// x wont be available here. Uncomment below and check
  //console.error('x is not defined here', x);

// you can make a let or const variable block scoped simply by putting them inside {}

{
  const person = {
    name : 't-rex',
    age: 23
  }
  console.log('child scope has more preference in case of nested scoping');
  console.log('inner person', person);
}
console.log('outer person', person);

// another issue that let solves is async closure and IIFE
console.info('\nasync closure and IIFE');
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  var x = (function() {
    var j = i;
    return function() {
      console.info('j', j);
    }  
  })();
  setTimeout(x, 1000);
}

// above problem of async can be easily done by below
//console.log('\nasync using let');
for(var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  setTimeout(function(){
    console.log('let j', i);
  },1000);
}
