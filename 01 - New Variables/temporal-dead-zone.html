		Accessing a var before it is declared has the result undefined

		Accessing a let or const before it is declared throws ReferenceError	

		Referencing let or const variable in the block before the initialization results in a ReferenceError (contrary to a variable declared with var, which will just have the undefined value). The variable is in a "temporal dead zone" from the start of the block until the initialization is processed

  var pasta = 'with red sauce'; // will not throw error but print 'undefined'

  /* temporal dead zone example with const */

  console.log(pizza); // pizza is not defined here so it will throw an error
  const pizza = 'Deep Dish üçïüçïüçï';

  Another example of temporal dead zone combined with lexical scoping
