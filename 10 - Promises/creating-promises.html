    /*
    The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

    Promise is created using construction functions in which a functions called executor function is passed as argument to constructor with two args resolve and reject which also are functions.

    The executor normally initiates some asynchronous work, and then, once that completes, either calls the resolve function to resolve the promise or else rejects it if an error occurred.
    If an error is thrown in the executor function, the promise is rejected. The return value of the executor is ignored.
